In 2010 I convinced my employer, the [Epitec Group][1], to open source our project management software, which we called Epiworx. 

This is my first foray into open source community, so if you see me doing something wrong, or have a better idea on how to manage/contribute to this project, please let me know ... this is a learning experience!

I can be reached at [mattruma@gmail.com][2] or on twitter at [http://www.twitter.com/mattruma][3].

Thanks and looking forward to seeing other developers contributions soon!
