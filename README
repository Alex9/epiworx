In 2010 I convinced my employer, the Epitec Group, to open source our project management software. This is my first foray into open source, so if you I am doing something wrong, or you have a better idea on how to manage/contribute to this project, please let me know! I can always be reached at mattruma@gmail.com or on twitter at http://www.twitter.com.

Thanks and looking forward to seeing other developers contributions soon!
